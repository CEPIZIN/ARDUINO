Arduino LED Animation
This Arduino sketch is designed to create an LED animation that spells out the word "LAURA" using multiple built-in LEDs. Each letter is displayed using a specific pattern of LED activations.

Hardware Setup

LED 1: Connected to pin 13 (LED_BULTIN1)
LED 2: Connected to pin 12 (LED_BULTIN2)
LED 3: Connected to pin 11 (LED_BULTIN3)
LED 4: Connected to pin 10 (LED_BULTIN4)
LED 5: Connected to pin 9 (LED_BULTIN5)
Code Explanation
The code uses a sequence of digitalWrite and delay commands to control the LEDs and create the desired animation. Each letter is represented by a series of LED activations and delays to achieve the animation effect.

How to Use
Set up your Arduino board and connect the LEDs as described in the "Hardware Setup" section.
Upload the code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
Observe the LED animation that spells out "LURA".
Feel free to modify the code to create different animations or customize the LED patterns.

How to Use

Navigate through the folders related to projects, sensors, or communication types to find the code you are interested in.

Within each folder, you will find a .ino file that contains the source code for the specific project, sensor, or communication.

Read the README.md file in each folder to get detailed information about the code, such as project descriptions, connection diagrams, and usage instructions.
